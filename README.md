# Smokeball-test

Attached is the Smokeball developer project. 

We encourage you to over-engineer the solution 
(for instance dependency injection, unit/integration test projects) and build a WPF UI.  

See this project as a selling tool for your skills. 
Many candidates complete the test with a working solution, 
but it isn’t structured in a way that demonstrates how they would ship production code, if they were hired.

To gain a better understanding of your technical, design and logic skills, 
we would like you to create a project in C#.NET that will perform the following:

The CEO from Smokeball is very interested in SEO and how this can improve Sales. 
Every morning he logs in to google.com.au and types in the same key words “conveyancing software” 
and counts down to see where and how many times their company, www.smokeball.com.au sits on the list.

Seeing the CEO do this every day, a smart software developer at Smokeball decides 
to write a small application for him that will automatically perform this operation and return the result to the screen.

They design and code some software that receives a string of keywords, and a string URL. 
This is then processed to return a string of numbers for where the resulting URL is found in Google. 
For example “1, 10, 33” or “0”.

The CEO is only interested if their URL appears in the first 100 results.
